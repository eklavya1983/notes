Pipeline
Pipeline is made up of handler.  Each handler can be inbound, outbound or both.  Inbound handlers are invoked in sequence for upstream.  Outbound handlers are invoked in sequence for downstream.
StringCodec is a good example of a handler that is both inbound as well as outbound.


Handler
HandleBase is the base class that knows about pipeline and Context
Handler interface provides read/write interfaces
InboundHandler needs to provide read functionality
OutboundHandler needs to provide write functionality
HandlerAdapter is a Handler that just forwards reads/writes down the pipeline by just invoking fireRead/fireWrite on the context.
